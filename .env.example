#
# PRODUCTION (vault mode - recommended):
#   Secrets are stored in an encrypted .vault file and entered
#   via the /unlock page at startup. Only non-secret config
#   goes here. Create the vault with: python vault.py create
#
# DEVELOPMENT (direct mode):
#   Put everything here including secrets. The app starts
#   immediately without requiring an unlock step.
